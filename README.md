# NDatabase
Import from https://ndatabase.codeplex.com

NDatabase is a easy to use .NET Object Database. To avoid impedance mismatch overhead between Object and Relational worlds, give a try to NDatabase. NDatabase is a new generation Object Database: a real native and transparent persistence layer for .NET.
Object because the basic persistent unit is an object, not a table.
Native and Transparent because it directly persists objects the way they exist in the native programming language, without any conversion.

Using NDatabase as your persistence layer will let you focus on your business logic allowing storing and retrieving native objects in a single line of code. No more Relational to Object mapping is necessary, NDatabase just persists objects the way they are, no matter their complexity.
